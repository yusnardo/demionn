				<p>
					Demion is education website. Demion is website that you can learn something and create online experience learning. Now day education is old fashioned.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The formal education is not creative at all. The student come to school and learn, every single day is like that. Student do their homework and find out the answer from internet, this is reality. So, Demion create a new learning experience. Hope all of you enjoyed our feature.
